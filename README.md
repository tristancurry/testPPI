Simple example of how to get pixel density on PC and Android. This displays a box approximately 2 inches across.

It might not be completely accurate, but probably good enough for many applications. Comparison between phone screen and laptop revealed a 3mm difference.

Platform detection would be nice, but for now just comment in/out the relevant bits of code.
